Latest version:
* git://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY.git


 Requirements
-------------

CVSAnalY has the following dependencies:

    * RepositoryHandler
        git clone git://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/RepositoryHandler.git
    * cvs (optional, for CVS support)
    * subversion (optional, for SVN support)
    * git (optional, for Git support)
    * Python MySQLDB (optional but recommended)
    * Python SQLite (optional)


Scripts
-------

Some useful scripts for performing reseach studies (activity,
generations, etc) can be found in the next link:

        http://git.libresoft.es/libcvsanaly2

You can get the code from the git repository:

        git clone git://git.libresoft.es/git/libcvsanaly2
        git clone http://git.libresoft.es/libcvsanaly2

 Installation
-------------

You can install cvsanaly2 just by running setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

This will install it in the python default directories in your system.

If you don't install CVSAnalY with root privileges, or don't want
to install it in the default directories, you can also use the source
code directory, as cloned from the main git repo. It is enough to
configure your PATH and PYTHONPATH so that cvsanaly2, and the Python
modules it needs, are found.

Add to your $PATH the directory which contains cvsanaly 
(cvsanalydir is the directory where CVSAnalY is installed):

    $ export PATH=$PATH:cvsanalydir

In PYHTONPATH, you need to include both the dirs for CVSAnalY and
RepositoryHandler (except if it is installed in the default Python dirs
in your system). If repohandlerdir is the path where RepositoryHandler
is installed:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:cvsanalydir:repohandlerdir

You are ready to use cvsanaly2!


 Running cvsanaly2
------------------

For the impatients: just checkout (from svn or cvs) to obtain a local
version of your repository, and then run cvsanaly2:

    $ cd project/
    ~/project$ cvsanaly2 

More options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be
learnt by running "cvsanaly2 --help"
